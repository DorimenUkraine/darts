# Changelog

Darts is still in an early development phase and we cannot always guarantee backwards compatibility. Changes suceptible to **break existing code** working on a previous release are marked with a "&#x1F534;". Sorry for the inconvenience!

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/develop)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.3.0...develop)

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.3.0) (2020-10-dd)

### For users of the library:
**Added:**

- Indexing on TimeSeries [\#150](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/150)
- New `FourTheta` forecasting model [\#123](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/123), [\#156](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/156)
- `map()` method for TimeSeries [\#121](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/121), [\#166](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/166)
- Further improved Multivariate TimeSeries capabilities:
  - Added multivariate support to the Neural Network based forecasting models, namely `TorchForecastingModel` and its subclasses (`TCNModel` and `RNNModel`)
  - Added multivariate support to backtesting functions [\#111](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/111)
- Custom style for matplotlib plots [\#191](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/191)
- Option to pass a single string as value column name to the `TimeSeries.from_dataframe()` function. [\#114](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/114)
- sMAPE metric [\#129](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/129)
- `freq` parameter for TimeSeries generating functions [\#157](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/157)
- Option to specify a `random_state` at model creation using the `@random_method` decorator on models using neural networks to allow reproducibility of results [\#118](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/118)

**Changed:**

- &#x1F534; **Refactored backtesting** [\#184](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/184)
  - Moved backtesting functionalities inside `ForecastingModel` and `RegressionModel`
    - Old syntax: `backtest_forecasting()` and `backtest_regression()`
    - New syntax: `model.backtest()`
  - Consequently removed the `backtesting` module
- &#x1F534; `ForecastingModel` `fit()` **method syntax** using TimeSeries indexing instead of additional parameters [\#161](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/161)
  ```python
  # old syntax:
  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, target_indices=[0, 1])

  # new syntax:
  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, multivariate_series[["0", "1"]])

  # old syntax:
  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, component_index=2)

  # new syntax:
  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series["2"])
  ```

**Fixed:**
- Solved issue of TorchForecastingModel.predict(n) throwing an error at n=1. [\#108](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/108)
- Fixed MASE metrics [\#129](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/129)
- \[BUG\] ForecastingModel.backtest: Can bypass sanity checks [\#188](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/188)
- ForecastingModel.backtest\(\) fails if forecast\_horizon isn't provided [\#186](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/186)

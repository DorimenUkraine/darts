Forecasting Model Base Class

A forecasting model captures the future values of a time series as a function of the past as follows:

.. math:: y_{t+1} = f(y_t, y_{t-1}, ..., y_1),

where :math:`y_t` represents the time series' value(s) at time :math:`t`.

        """ A function for finding the best hyperparameters.

        This function has 3 modes of operation: Expanding window mode, split mode and fitted value mode.
        The three modes of operation evaluate every possible combination of hyperparameter values
        provided in the `parameters` dictionary by instantiating the `model_class` subclass
        of ForecastingModel with each combination, and returning the best-performing model with regards
        to the `metric` function. The `metric` function is expected to return an error value,
        thus the model resulting in the smallest `metric` output will be chosen.
        The relationship of the training data and test data depends on the mode of operation.

        Expanding window mode (activated when `fcast_horizon_n` is passed):
        For every hyperparameter combination, the model is repeatedly trained and evaluated on different
        splits of `training_series` and `target_series`. The number of splits is equal to `num_predictions`, and the
        forecasting horizon used when making a prediction is `fcast_horizon_n`.
        Note that the model is retrained for every single prediction, thus this mode is slower.

        Split window mode (activated when `val_series` is passed):
        This mode will be used when the `val_series` argument is passed.
        For every hyperparameter combination, the model is trained on `training_series` + `target_series` and
        evaluated on `val_series`.

        Fitted value mode (activated when `use_fitted_values` is set to `True`):
        For every hyperparameter combination, the model is trained on `training_series` + `target_series`
        and evaluated on the resulting fitted values.
        Not all models have fitted values, and this method raises an error if `model.fitted_values` does not exist.
        The fitted values are the result of the fit of the model on the training series. Comparing with the
        fitted values can be a quick way to assess the model, but one cannot see if the model overfits or underfits.

        fcast_horizon_n
            The integer value of the forecasting horizon used in expanding window mode.
        use_full_output_length
            In case `model` is a subclass of `TorchForecastingModel`, this argument will be passed along

        val_target_series

        num_predictions:
            The number of train/prediction cycles performed in one iteration of expanding window mode.
        use_fitted_values
            If `True`, uses the comparison with the fitted values.
            Raises an error if `fitted_values` is not an attribute of `model_class`.
        metric:
